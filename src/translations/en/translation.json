    "quote": "Wow, you draw so beautifully!\n Could you draw something for me too?",
    "phrase1": "â€“ perhaps this was the most motivating sentence throughout my childhood. In school\n I always looked forward to art class and breaks, that's when I could truly be the shining star of the class.\n Somehow it all started from there, from tigers drawn with black markers.",
    "phrase2": "Later, I set out in the rudimentary Hungarian tattoo world without formal training, with a folder of drawn designs and unwavering determination, at 17. Many turned me away, a few helped, and during the Balaton summer seasons, they let me get close to the action. I officially started working as a tattoo artist with the Celtic Moon Tattoo team, working alongside James, from whom I really learned this wonderful profession.",
    "phrase3": "In the absence of art schools, I discovered many things through tattooing, and perhaps even myself.",
    "phrase4": "Many years have passed since then, and now I work in my own studio, occasionally guest tattooing abroad, and I'm very happy to be a tattoo artist. ðŸ˜¸"
