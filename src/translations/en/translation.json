    "quote": "Wow, you draw so beautifully!\nCould you draw something for me too?",
    "phrase1": "â€“ perhaps this was the most motivating phrase throughout my childhood. In school, I always couldn't wait for art class and breaks, as that's when I could truly be the star of the class. Somehow it all started from there, from tigers drawn with black markers.",
    "phrase2": "Later I set out in the primitive tattoo world of Hungary without formal training, with a portfolio of drawn designs and unwavering determination, at the age of 17. Many turned me away, a few helped, and during the Balaton summer seasons, I was allowed quite close to the action. I first officially started working as a tattoo artist with the Celtic Moon Tattoo team, working alongside James, from whom I truly learned this wonderful profession.",
    "phrase3": "In the absence of art schools, I learned a lot through tattooing, but perhaps I even discovered myself.",
    "phrase4": "Many years have passed since then, and now I work in my own studio, occasionally guest tattooing abroad, and I am very happy to be a tattoo artist. ðŸ˜¸"
